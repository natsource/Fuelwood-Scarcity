Fuelwood-Scarcity
=================

Calculates fuelwood scarcity from forest growth days, forest density and human population density.

This program calculates fuelwood scarcity adapted from R. Scholes'
methodology used in the Millenium Ecosystem Assessment (Scholes, R.J.
and Biggs, R. 2004. Ecosystem services in Southern Africa: a regional
assessment. Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Pretoria,
South Africa).

The details are described in in the TEAM Fuelwood Scarcity Implementation 
Manual available at:
www.teamnetwork.org/files/anp/pdfs/TEAM%20Monitoring%20Protocol_Fuelwood%20Scarcity_February%202011.pdf

The input data are (all at 1 km resolution):
1) Percent woody cover
2) Number of growth days in the current year (2010)
3) Human population density

All data layers have to be 1 km resolution matching the respective 10 x 10 km landscape boundary.
